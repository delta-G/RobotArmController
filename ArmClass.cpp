/*
 *
 * Now inverse Kinematics
 * This is a herder nut to crack
 *
 * Let's start by saying where we want the tip.
 *
 * We can do something similar to how we solved the problem in
 * the forward case.  Let's devolve it into a 2D problem
 *
 * We know the angle that the desired point makes with the centerline
 * of the bot.  So we know the angle that the base servo has to go to.
 * It's the same conversion from polar to cartesian that we had on
 * the forward kinematics.  Then we calculate a radial distance and
 * turn it into a 2D problem for the rest of the servos.
 *
 * So we place the gripper tip in our 2D plane.
 * Then we can calculate an arc about that point that represents
 * all the places that the wrist servo could possibly be.
 * From there we can choose the point on that arc closest to
 * where the wrist is now.
 *
 * Then from there we do something similar with the elbow.
 * From the wrist position we calculate an arc of places the
 * elbow could be.  We caculate an arc of places the elbow could be
 * from the shoulder's point of view.  Where those two intersect is
 * where the elbow needs to go.  If there are two intersections then
 * we take the one that is closest to where the elbow is now OR we
 * take the one that involves the least movement of servos.
 *
 *
 * We need LOTS AND LOTS of safety built in.  If it tries to go to a position
 * that it can't do then we need safeties.
 *
 *
 *
 * It may be simpler than I think.  If we know the position of the tip and
 * the end angle of the claw, then we know exactly the position of the wrist.
 * From there it is spherical geometry.  The distance from the shoulder servo
 * gives the elbow angle and then the point on that sphere determines the shoulder
 * and the base angle.
 *
 * The trick is what if the position can't be reached with that given claw angle.
 * How do we then determine what angle to use?  We would have to do like above and
 * generate an arc and find intersections.  But the wrist position creates a pretty
 * good 3D field.  Maybe we need to just go ahead and define it.
 *
 * It can't be hard.  Most of it is as simple as defining spheres or sections of spheres.
 * There's a bubble where your max reach is.  Another bubble around the base of the arm.
 * A slightly more intricate set of bubbles around the tank base.  It looks like it can all
 * be modeled with spheres.  Time to bone up on 3D geometry.
 *
 */


/*
 *  First is the simple case.  We give the tip position and angle of the gripper.
 *  This means that we can directly calculate wrist position.
 *
 *  From wrist position there are only two solutions to elbow and shoulder
 *  One is the "elbow-up" position and the other is "elbow-down"
 *
 *  Because our robot has the big head on it, I think we only want to consider
 *  elbow up possibilities.  Maybe there are cases and we can explore that later.
